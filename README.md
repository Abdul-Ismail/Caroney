# Caroney

A machine learning project that allows you to predict the current and future price of a car.

Using puppeteer I managed to scrape over 100,000 data on Irish cars that are up for sale or have been sold. A decision-tree model was trained using this scraped data.

## Getting prediction
<ul>
  <li>The application has been hosted on the following link: https://caroney.herokuapp.com/ </li>
  <li>To get the current price of your car enter in your car details and hit the predict price button </li>
  <li>To get the future price of your car, select future price option and then pick the year you internd to sell the car and the predicted mileage that the car will be sold with.</li>
</ul>


## Objective

<ul>
  <li>The main objective of this project was to get an introduction into machine learning.</li>
  <li>I started of with the most simple machine learning model, which I found to be a decision tree.</li>
  <li>Fully implemented the decision tree without the use of any libraries.</li>
</ul>

## Outcome

<ul>
  <li>Managed to get an accuracy of over 60% which I was happy with as I did not use any libraries and was my first attempt at a machine learning project</li>
  <ul>
